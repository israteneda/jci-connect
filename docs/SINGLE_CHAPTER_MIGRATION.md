# Single-Chapter Architecture Migration

**Date:** January 6, 2025  
**Purpose:** Convert JCI Connect from multi-chapter to single-chapter architecture

## Overview

JCI Connect has been migrated from a multi-chapter system to a single-chapter deployment model. Each chapter now deploys their own independent instance of the software, eliminating the need for chapter management within the application.

## Key Changes

### 1. Database Schema Changes

#### Removed
- `chapters` table - No longer needed as each installation serves one chapter
- `chapter_id` foreign key from `memberships` table
- `chapter_id` foreign key from `board_positions` table
- Chapter-related functions: `increment_chapter_members()`, `decrement_chapter_members()`

#### Modified
- **board_positions** table:
  - Removed `chapter_id` column
  - Changed `level` enum from `('chapter', 'national', 'international')` to `('local', 'national', 'international')`
  - Removed `valid_chapter_position` constraint
  - Updated to support local (chapter), national, and international positions without chapter references

- **memberships** table:
  - Removed `chapter_id` column (was required, now removed entirely)
  - Simplified to store membership information without chapter association

### 2. Frontend Changes

#### Files Deleted
- `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/Chapters.tsx`
- `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/ChapterDetail.tsx`
- `frontend/src/hooks/useChapters.ts`

#### Files Modified
- **Router (`router.tsx`)**: Removed chapter routes
- **Sidebar (`Sidebar.tsx`)**: Removed "Chapters" navigation item
- **Database Types (`database.types.ts`)**: Removed chapters table types, updated memberships and board_positions
- **useMembers Hook**: Removed chapter queries and chapter_id from mutations
- **useBoardPositions Hook**: Removed chapter references, updated to use 'local' instead of 'chapter'
- **MemberFormDialog**: Removed chapter selection, simplified membership creation
- **Dashboard**: Removed chapter stats, simplified recent members display
- **Members**: Changed "Chapter" column to "Membership Type"
- **MemberDetail**: Removed chapter information section
- **Permissions System**: Removed 'chapters' resource, added 'board_positions' resource

### 3. Migration Path

To apply these changes to an existing database:

1. Run the migration: `supabase/migrations/20250106000000_remove_chapters.sql`
2. This migration will:
   - Update board_positions to use 'local' instead of 'chapter'
   - Remove chapter_id from both memberships and board_positions
   - Drop all chapter-related tables, functions, and policies

### 4. Board Position Levels

The three levels of board positions are maintained:

- **Local**: Chapter-level positions (President, VP, Secretary, etc.)
- **National**: National organization positions
- **International**: JCI International positions

Members can hold positions at any or all levels simultaneously.

### 5. Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Important**: This is a breaking change that affects:

1. **Existing Data**: 
   - All chapter associations will be lost
   - Member numbers will need to be regenerated if they relied on chapter codes
   - Existing board positions marked as 'chapter' level will be automatically renamed to 'local'

2. **API Changes**:
   - Removed all chapter-related endpoints
   - `createMember` no longer requires or accepts `chapter_id`
   - Board position creation no longer requires `chapter_id` for local positions

3. **UI Changes**:
   - Removed entire chapter management section
   - Dashboard stats reduced from 5 to 4 cards
   - Member list shows membership type instead of chapter name

## Benefits of Single-Chapter Architecture

1. **Simplicity**: Reduced complexity for chapter administrators
2. **Autonomy**: Each chapter has full control over their instance
3. **Data Privacy**: Chapter data is completely isolated
4. **Scalability**: Easier to scale per-chapter as each is independent
5. **Customization**: Chapters can customize their instance without affecting others

## Future Considerations

- **Inter-Chapter Communication**: If chapters need to share data, consider implementing API integrations
- **National-Level Reporting**: May need to aggregate data from multiple chapter instances
- **Backup Strategy**: Each chapter is responsible for their own backups

## Documentation Updates

Updated documentation files:
- `README.md` - Updated to reflect single-chapter architecture
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - Should be updated to remove chapter references
- `BOARD_POSITIONS.md` - Updated to clarify 'local' vs 'chapter' terminology
- `PERMISSIONS.md` - Updated resource list

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Verify member creation works without chapter selection
- [ ] Verify board positions can be created at local, national, and international levels
- [ ] Verify member list displays correctly without chapter column
- [ ] Verify dashboard stats display correctly (4 cards instead of 5)
- [ ] Verify all chapter-related routes return 404
- [ ] Run database migration on a test instance
- [ ] Verify RLS policies work correctly without chapter context
- [ ] Test member number generation without chapter codes

## Rollback Plan

If needed to rollback:

1. Restore database from backup taken before migration
2. Revert to previous git commit: `git revert <migration-commit>`
3. Redeploy previous version

**Note**: Rollback should only be done immediately after migration. Once new data is created in the single-chapter model, rollback will result in data loss.
